# Web Scraping Automation for Teachers Using Cheerio and React

## Overview
This project is a web scraping tool designed to automate regular tasks for teachers using the Saudi Arabian education portal [Noor](https://noor.moe.gov.sa/). It was built using **Cheerio** for scraping and **React** for the frontend. The project aimed to simplify tasks like:

1. Bulk grading students by assigning the same grade to all students in a class.
2. Generating detailed reports about students' performance.

## Key Features

### Bulk Grading
Teachers can assign the same grade to multiple students at once, reducing repetitive manual work and saving significant time.

### Performance Reports
Generate comprehensive reports on students' performance metrics, providing teachers with actionable insights for better academic decision-making.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Web Scraping**: Cheerio.js
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions

## Challenges and Limitations
- **Dynamic Changes**: The Noor portal frequently updates its layout and backend structure, making scraping difficult to maintain.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Web scraping can raise ethical and legal issues if not performed within the boundaries of terms of service.

## Current Status
This project is **no longer functional** as the Noor portal's layout and backend have changed significantly since the project was developed. Development work has been halted.

## How It Worked
1. **Login Automation**: Teachers logged into the Noor portal using their credentials.
2. **Task Automation**:
   - Cheerio was used to scrape relevant data from the portal.
   - React provided an interactive interface for teachers to perform bulk grading and generate reports.
3. **Data Presentation**: The results were presented in a user-friendly manner, allowing teachers to download or print reports.

## Disclaimer
This project was created for educational purposes and to explore the automation of repetitive tasks. The use of web scraping must comply with the terms of service of the targeted website. Unauthorized scraping can lead to legal consequences.

## Future Work
While this project is no longer functional, a future version could:
- Use APIs (if provided by the Noor portal) for secure and sustainable automation.
- Adapt to changes in the Noor portal layout and backend endpoints updates.
